                        <h2>Access to Finance</h2>
                        <p>
                            Financial institutions in Africa are, in general, 
                            unfamiliar with agricultural lending and 
                            specifically unfamiliar the seasonality of the 
                            agricultural commodities and the cycle for processing.
                             The need to understand that the procurement of raw materials 
                             is an annual event and that purchases must be in quantities 
                             sufficient to meet the capacity of the processing unit for its
                              annual uninterrupted efficient production is crucial.

                            Thus, we are providing a program that seeks to 
                            link financial institutions to the agribusiness value 
                            chain that will bring together the stakeholders and the
                            financial institutions in a B2B forum.
